## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I will be learning more about CSS Animations with React and adding interactivity as dealing with css and react components through classes was a bit complicated.
