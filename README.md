# Hanif Barbhuiya's Frontend projects

- This repository is to add projects that I build for practice
- Each project's name start with either N, J, I, A or G

- I make projects from frontend mentor primarily
- They have a nice way to classify projects based on it's difficulty
 - N ~ newbie
 - J ~ junior
 - I ~ intermediate
 - A ~ advance
 - G ~ Guru 

- So based on these naming I have named my projects in " _difficulty_-**project-name** " format
