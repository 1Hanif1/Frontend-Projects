# Frontend projects

This repository is to add projects that I build for practicing frontend development.
Each project's name starts with either N, J, I, A or G

Most of my projects are made from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) - They provide assets to create real world projects in the form of challenges. Really helpful for anyone wanting to improve their frontend skills :)

They have a nice way to classify projects based on it's difficulty

- N ~ newbie
- J ~ junior
- I ~ intermediate
- A ~ advance
- G ~ Guru

So based on these naming I have named my projects in " _difficulty_-**project-name** " format
